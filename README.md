# Point-in-Polygon-Detection
## Description 
- The codes provided are an optimized solution to the point-polygon query program mentioned by the **ACM SIGSPATIAL CUP
2013**, guaranteeing a high absolute accuracy rate
- The efficient algorithm that accelerates **’inside’** and **’within n’** relationship queries by at 5
seconds utilizing hierarchical indices
- The final report for the project is also attached for further details

## How to Run Code 
- Run `python3 inside.py` to get the results for INSIDE query on the testing data
- Run `python3 within.py` to get the results for 'within n' query on the testing data
